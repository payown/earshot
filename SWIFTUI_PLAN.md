# Earshot SwiftUI Conversion Plan

Living task log for the SwiftUI rebuild on the `swift` branch. Maintained by the
Planning Agent. The Flutter app (`lib/`, `ios/`, `tool/`) and TestFlight are
read-only references — never modified, never deployed from this branch.

land): Transcripts (5.6), Local audio import (5.8), Notifications (5.10), Sharing /
Universal Links (5.11).

## Decisions Log

- **Decision:** Feature-first layout `Earshot/Features/<feature>/{Data,Domain,Presentation}`, migrating the flat `EarshotSwift/Sources/` slice. **Reason:** documented CLAUDE.md standard; cheap while small. **Issue:** #336.
- **Decision:** Clean, versioned, migratable SwiftData store; no Flutter(drift/SQLite)→SwiftUI import for now. **Reason:** the `.swift` bundle id installs alongside Flutter in a separate sandbox and can't see `earshot.db`; cross-engine import is a future task. **Issue:** #337.
- **Decision:** Full model graph defined up front behind a VersionedSchema before feature UI. **Reason:** SwiftData "define all models before UI" rule; keeps later migrations lightweight. **Issue:** #337.
- **Note:** Live Flutter drift schema is version 16 (not 12). The SwiftData model graph mirrors v16.
- **Note:** The 42 existing open GitHub issues are the Flutter production backlog. They are left untouched (not relabeled/closed) per the "never close without confirmation" rule. SwiftUI work is tracked under new `[SwiftUI]` issues #336–#351.
- **Decision:** The feature-first source tree lives at `EarshotSwift/Earshot/` (co-located with `Earshot.xcodeproj`), not at the repo root as CLAUDE.md's diagram shows. **Reason:** keeps XcodeGen source paths relative and simple; avoids cross-directory project references. The `Earshot/Features/...` convention itself is honored. **Issue:** #336.
- **Note:** No `iPhone 16` simulator is installed on this machine; verification uses `iPhone 17`. Build/test destination: `platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17`.
- **Decision (F2):** SwiftData unit tests share ONE in-memory `ModelContainer` per process (`TestStore`, wiped between tests) instead of creating a container per test. **Reason:** rapidly creating many in-memory containers for the same schema in one test process crashes with an `EXC_BREAKPOINT` in `context.insert` (toolchain/SwiftData issue, reproduced and bisected). The real app uses a single container, so it is unaffected. The test host also uses a throwaway placeholder container during XCTest. **Issue:** #337.
- **Decision (F2):** The model graph keeps cascade collections only on `Podcast.episodes`, `Episode.bookmarks`, `Episode.queueItem`, `Episode.recentlyExpired`, and `PodcastFolder.memberships`. `ListeningSession` and `FolderMembership` reference their parents via plain to-one relationships, so deleting a Podcast does NOT auto-cascade its listening sessions or folder memberships. **Reason:** keeps the relationship graph simple. **Follow-up:** Stats (#348) and Folders (#346) must clean up orphaned `ListeningSession`/`FolderMembership` rows on podcast/episode delete.
